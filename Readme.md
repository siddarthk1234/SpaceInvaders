1) What does my Project do?
My project lets user shoot 3 different types of aliens for points by pressing the space keys. It also lets user move from
left to right using the right and left arrow keys. All of these features are fully functional. An explosion animation plays when an 
alien is destroyed.
2) In order to have this game up an running you need some type of editor such as pycharm. Before you install Pycharm
you are going to need Python2.7-Python3.7. After this you will need to click on File-> Preferences For New Projects -> and then choose
a Python 2.7-3.7 Interpreter. Finally you need to install the package Pygame. After this you are set to run the game.
3) After you have installed the Pygame package as already mentioned you are ready to run the game.
